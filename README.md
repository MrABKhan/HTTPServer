# HTTPServer
#### Extremely Small Test Project.

This is an example demonstration of Socket Programming at a basic level in Java. It receives requests at a Port and sends a simple OK response. Although this can be heavily modified and upgraded for more usage, I'm using this as a git motivation and habit building pilot project. :)


# Build 
1. Use Maven for importing and compiling the files.
2. Add **Port** Number as Command-Line Arguments and Run.
3. Goto your Browser and http://localhost:**Port**/.
